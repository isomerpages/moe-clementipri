### P4 Speak Right (Readers' Theatre)

Our P4 continue to hone oral communication skills that they pick up in P3 through the P4 English Enrichment Programme – Speak Right! (Readers’ Theatre). In this programme, pupils’ knowledge and skills on how to be an effective speaker are reinforced; these include facial expressions, body language and eye contact. Their delivery skills are honed and they are taught to pay attention to the 5 Ps of delivery (Power, Pace, Pitch, Pronunciation, Pause). Pupils’ knowledge and skills are honed through active participation and reading of a wide range of theatre scripts. Pupils are given customized, individual feedback so that they understand their strengths and continue to work on areas for improvement.

Here are some things that our pupils have said about this programme:
* “I learnt about how to speak fluently and with eye contact. The 4P's were useful. They are the pace, pitch, pause and power. The enrichment helped me to be more fluent and expressive.” (Karyn)
* “I learnt to be expressive and confident in performing in front of others after the enrichment.” (Zi Ying)
* “I learnt to read with good expression when I use good pace, pitch, pause and power. I liked the performance that we had as it gave me more confidence and show others what I have learnt.” (Haoqing)
* “I learnt to speak and read fluently and feel confident standing in front of an audience. I liked the performance that we did with the other classes. We get to see what they have learnt and likewise they get to see ours.” (Jarett)
