### Malay Pelakon Cilik

#### Pelakon Cilik

The Malay speech and drama enrichment programme is aimed at developing the oral communication skills of Clementians in an engaging way. It provides opportunities for Clementians to learn and practise vocalisation techniques while developing their creativity and social skills. At the end of the programme, all budding performers get a chance to put up a performance to put what they have learnt to the test.
