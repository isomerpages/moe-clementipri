### Lower Primary Sports Day

#### P3 In The Hall
For the Lower Primary Sports Day, our P3 pupils have the opportunity to participate in their respective level relay which provides them the perfect vehicle to demonstrate the fundamental movements skills acquired during PE lessons to their supportive parents in the stands. Under the guidance of their teachers-in-charge, our Sports and CCA leaders lead by example as they assist the PE department to manage the logistical demands of the event and inspire the younger Clementians to assume the mantle when their time arrives.
