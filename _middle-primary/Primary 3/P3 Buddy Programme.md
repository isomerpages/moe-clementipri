### P3 Buddy Programme

#### P3 Buddy Programme with P1 Clementians
Clementi Primary School believes in the benefits of the annual ‘Buddy’ Programme. It is part of our Values Inculcation Programme that develops character and promotes friendship and support between the older and younger Clementians. As the P1 and P3 Clementians share the same recess, buddying the two levels helps ensure that there is continued support for the buddies throughout the year.<br>
The ‘Buddy’ Programme helps to foster a sense of whole-school community. The programme create friendships between older and younger ‘buddies’ and develop positive school behaviour for all Clementians.
