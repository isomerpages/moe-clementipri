### VIA
Our Primary 3 Clementians will be engaged in the Project Buddy Clean, an initiative by National Environmental Agency. Clementians will attend a customised Buddy Clean workshop which aims to introduce them to the consequences of littering and the need to keep their school clean. Clementians will be engaged in meaningful discussions on the importance to keep our physical environment clean and also on the role of cleaners to develop empathy and respect for them.
