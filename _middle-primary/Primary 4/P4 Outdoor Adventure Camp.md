### P4 Outdoor Adventure Camp

P4 Outdoor Adventure Camp

In 2019, Clementi Primary participated in the Ministry of Education Cohort Camp Programme. This is part of the National Outdoor Adventure Education Masterplan which MOE has put in place to strengthen the holistic development of all our students. The programme seeks to develop ruggedness, resilience, and build cohesion amongst our children.

The P4 Adventure Camp 2019 was planned and implemented for all Primary 4 Clementians. Using the outdoors as the ‘classroom’ for learning and development, the camp offered Clementians a unique opportunity to work together as a small team and to overcome various outdoor challenges.

For the first time this year, Clementians had the experience of camping at one of two campsites, namely the Changi Coast Outdoor Adventure Learning Centre and the Dairy Farm Outdoor Adventure Learning Centre.
