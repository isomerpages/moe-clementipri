### Learning Journey

#### Learning Journey to Chinatown Heritage Centre
As part of the Social Studies curriculum, our P4 pupils went on a learning journey to the Chinatown Heritage Centre. Through the multi-sensory experience, pupils learnt about Singapore’s early pioneers who made Chinatown their home and appreciate how we have moved together as a nation from the contributions of our early settlers.

Chinatown Heritage Centre presents an eye-opening experience of the journey of Singapore, providing deeper insights and cultivating greater appreciation of the story and spirit of Singapore – the little red dot that succeeded to survive and thrive against the odds.
