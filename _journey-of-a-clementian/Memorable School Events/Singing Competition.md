### Singing Competition
#### Voices of Clementi
Singing competitions like Voices of Clementi are fun and provide great opportunities for our Primary 4 to 6 Clementians. Competitions may be nerve-wrecking but they are also exciting and filled with social opportunities. Clementians gain valuable experiences while performing in front of an audience and on a stage. They grow to be confident and resilient learners and performers in their ability to accept and give constructive feedback from and to their teachers and peers. Besides exhibiting their talent in the singing and performing, Clementians are empowered to lead the school in community singing platforms during the school’s National Day and Teachers’ Day celebrations.
