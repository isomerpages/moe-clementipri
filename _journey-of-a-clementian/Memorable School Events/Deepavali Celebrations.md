### Deepavali Celebrations

Every year, we organise the Deepavali celebrations to mark the arrival of this important traditional festival. Clementians showcase their skills and talents through various dance and song performances at the concert. To promote understanding and appreciation of the festival, exhibitions and quizzes are also organised for Clementians.
