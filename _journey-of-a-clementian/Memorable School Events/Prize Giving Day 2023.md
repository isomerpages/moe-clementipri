**Prize Giving Day 2023 cum Official Opening Ceremony of KidStudio**

Clementi Primary School celebrated her first Prize Giving Day on-site on 10 March 2023, Friday, after a 3-year hiatus, and it was truly a momentous event to remember. This year's ceremony was special because it also marked the official opening of KidStudio, a multi-disciplinary space where students' work will be featured.

We were honoured to have Mrs. Tan Siew Hong, the Guest of Honour, grace the occasion. Mrs. Tan was a well-loved former Vice Principal of the school and is currently the Principal of Sengkang Primary School. Her presence definitely added to the excitement of the day.

The event kicked off with a live streaming of the official opening ceremony of the KidStudio, where prize winners of the photography competition introduced their masterpieces. The opening of KidStudio was a proud moment for us as it marked the realisation of a dream that we had nurtured for a long time. The multi-disciplinary space provides a platform for our students to showcase their work and unleash their creativity. We believe that KidStudio will be a hub of creativity where our students can explore their passions and showcase their talents.

We also welcomed our freshly graduated P6s, donned in their secondary school uniforms, back to their alma mater, which was a heart-warming sight to behold. Our CCA groups put up stellar performances, and really wowed our audience which included our School Advisory Committee members, parents and all staff in the school. During the ceremony, our students were recognised for their outstanding performances in both academic and non-academic areas. We ended off the ceremony with a spectacular finale where our students’ dreams were penned on paper planes which took flight with the song “A Million Dreams”.

At the heart of the event was the theme "Dream. Believe. Achieve." We want to encourage all Clementians to embrace this theme and believe in themselves. The magic indeed lies in us, and it all starts with a dream where we believe that we can achieve what we set out to do and work hard towards it.

We want to thank everyone who had contributed and made Prize Giving Day 2023 cum Official Opening Ceremony of KidStudio a resounding success. It was indeed a day filled with pride, joy, and inspiration!
