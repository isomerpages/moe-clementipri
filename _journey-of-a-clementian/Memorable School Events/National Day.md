### National Day

On 8th August 2019, Clementi Primary School celebrated Singaporeâ€™s 54th birthday with a series of events. It started off with an Observance Ceremony, followed by the Choir Performance, the recitation of Recollections led by four Primary 2 students, a Quiz segment and the NDP workout.

We also had a sing-along session of some NDP songs before we proceeded on with the Games segment. The aims of the games are to build camaraderie and sportsmanship in our Clementians and also to foster togetherness as a community of Singaporeans. From their faces, we could tell that our Clementians truly enjoyed the celebration.
