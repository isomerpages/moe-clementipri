### Recitals
#### Library Recitals
Recitals provide our Clementians good opportunities to bring their musical skills and talents to the next level. They also serve as an important platform for boosting our studentsâ€™ confidence. Clementians learn about time management as they allocate time for their schoolwork and music practice. With the support of their parents, they take time to polish up their skills and practice their performance pieces. Even as a member of an audience during recitals, Clementians learn new skills such as practicing good audience etiquette and providing their friends constructive feedback.
