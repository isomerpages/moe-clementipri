### MTL Fortnight

**Mother Tongue Language Fortnight** <br>
The Mother Tongue Language (MTL) Fortnight is held annually, during which a range of activities related to Chinese / Malay / Tamil Language and culture will be conducted. The objectives of the two-week programme are to create an immersive environment for the learning of the MTL, where Clementians are given authentic opportunities to use their Mother Tongue language and develop appreciation for their Mother Tongue language and culture.
