### Hari Raya Celebrations

Every year, we organise the Hari Raya Celebrations to mark the arrival of this important festival. In anticipation of the arrival of Hari Raya Puasa, festive decorations are placed around the school compound to create a festive atmosphere. At the end of the Ramadan fasting month, Clementians showcase their skills and talents through various traditional dance and song performances. To promote understanding and appreciation of the festival, Clementians learn about the significance of Ramadan and how Hari Raya is celebrated in Singapore.
