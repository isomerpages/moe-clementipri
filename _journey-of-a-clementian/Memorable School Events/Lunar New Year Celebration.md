### Lunar New Year Celebration

Every year, we organise the Lunar New Year Celebrations to mark the arrival of this important Chinese festival. In anticipation of the Lunar New Year, festive decorations are placed around the school compound to create a festive atmosphere and Clementians participate in sing-a-long sessions during their CCE and Music lessons.

There are two segments on the day of the celebration. Clementians, led by their Form Teachers, will understand the significance of various traditions and engage in class activities relating to the festival such as paper cutting and making paper oranges and firecrackers. During the concert, Clementians are entertained with performances from various CCA groups such as the school band, choir and the Chinese dance troupe. They also enjoy the annual lion dance performance and other cultural performances.
