<p>Pupils in English Alpha+ attend reading circle sessions in Primary Four
where they are given unique opportunities for personal development, social
interaction and intellectual growth. Primary Five pupils are exposed to
creative writing to enhance their literary understanding and improve their
writing craft. Through exposure and practice in imaginative writing in
prose and poetry, they will engage in wordplay to express their thoughts,
ideas and feelings as well as acquire habits of mind essential to their
growth as critical and creative writers.&nbsp;</p>
