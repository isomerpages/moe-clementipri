<p>KidStudio was the school’s former art gallery. It was renovated in 2022.
Tiffany Looi Wing Yan from 3 Initiative in 2022 coined the name “KidStudio”
as part of the “Gallery Naming Competition”. Her suggestion received the
greatest number of votes from the students and staff in school. According
to Tiffany, KidStudio will be a place that showcases Clementians’ talent
worth celebrating.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The graphic sticker on the glass walls and door is designed by Yap Zi
Xuan from 3 Empathy in 2022. The design proposal for the visuals on the
glass walls and doors was opened to all Clementians. His design, “Jungle’s
Life”, was selected by the art teachers as it best presented the intent
of KidStudio. Like how the animals are gathered, KidStudio will see a collection
of various students’ work across various subjects and disciplines.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In KidStudio, Clementians are invited to showcase their talent whether
it is a painting, a sculpture, ceramics, a poem, a science project, a music
recital or even a performance! The possibilities are endless in KidStudio.
What a jungle of creativity and talent!</p>
