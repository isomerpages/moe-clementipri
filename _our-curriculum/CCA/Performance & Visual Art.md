<p><strong>Modern Dance CCA is an enriching programme designed to introduce young pupils to the world of contemporary dance. Through a variety of fun and engaging sessions, pupils learn not only the technical aspects of modern dance, such as flexibility, coordination, and strength but also build up values such as perseverance and self-discipline.</strong>
</p>
<p><strong>A professional instructor lead the sessions and the dance routines are age-appropriate and enjoyable; learning takes place in a supportive and positive environment. Modern Dance CCA also promotes teamwork, as pupils often work in groups to create performances, helping them to build social skills and friendships.</strong>
</p>
<p><strong>Performances are key components of the Modern Dance CCA, offering pupils the opportunity to showcase their skills and hard work. We have participated in both internal and external events including the annual Prize Giving Day concert and also Singapore Youth Festival.</strong>
</p>
<p><strong>We welcome all pupils who have a passion for dancing and who are keen to learn to join us.</strong>

<p><strong>Getting involved with Malay Dance CCA means developing personal quality traits like discipline and perseverance, as well teamwork, where each member looks out for another. They learn to cooperate, learn to teach each other, practise active listening and learn how to resolve conflicts. The Malay Dance CCA has achieved Certificate of Distinction for several consecutive SYF Arts Presentations and these happened due to the personal attitudes and teamwork of its members. Dancing improves gross and fine motor skills coordination concurrently and improves beat and rhythm recognition. Dancing is a stress reliever and allows personal expression through bodily movements. In Malay Dance, pupils will also learn to use instruments that accompany dances like tambourine and kompang and/or additional skills like silat.</strong>
