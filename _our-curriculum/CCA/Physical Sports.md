<p><strong>Rope skipping is an easy sport for everyone to pick up and we welcome all who are interested to learn. This is different from other sports whereby there is individual and team events for the student to take part in. Individually, pupils can take part in events such as running step or individual freestyle. As a team, pupils can try out double dutch where 2 ropes are being turned concurrently for the jumper.</strong>
