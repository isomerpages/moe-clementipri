curiosity, fosters imagination, and develops artistic skills, empowering
them to explore their unique creative potential.</p>

<h4>Key Programmes</h4>
<p><strong>Progressive Learning Experience</strong>
<br>Our art curriculum is structured to cater to different age groups, ensuring
a progressive learning experience. Starting with foundational skills in
drawing, painting, and crafting in the lower primary levels, students gradually
advance to more complex techniques such as printmaking, sculpture, and
digital art in the upper primary levels. This progression allows students
to build confidence and competence in various artistic forms.</p>
<p><strong>Diverse Artistic Exposure</strong>
<br>Our art programmes are designed to expose students to a wide range of
artistic styles, mediums, and cultural expressions. From traditional batik
painting and pottery to contemporary digital illustration and photography,
students are encouraged to explore and appreciate different forms of art.
This exposure not only enhances their creative skills but also broadens
their understanding of global cultures and histories.</p>
<p><strong>Participation in Local and National Art Competitions and Exhibitions </strong>
<br>Clementi Primary School encourages students to take part in local and
national art competitions and exhibitions. This not only provides a platform
for students to display their talents but also helps them gain valuable
experience, build confidence, and develop a sense of pride in their artistic
achievements.</p>
