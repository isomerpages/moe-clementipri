<p>Vision:
<br><strong>Every Clementian to be empowered and engaged as a 21st Century English Language learner who is an empathetic communicator, discerning reader and creative inquirer.</strong>
</p>
</blockquote>
<h4><strong>Key Programmes</strong></h4>
<p><strong>The EL Curriculum</strong>
<br>Pupils are immersed in language learning as they are exposed to various
age-appropriate genres of reading texts through the STELLAR programme,
English teachers employ various strategies such as the Shared Book Approach
(SBA), Modified Language Experience Approach (MLEA), the explicit teaching
of vocabulary and grammar, word study lesson, differentiated-focused lessons,
oracy-based activities and extensive reading to promote a love for the
English language and to hone students' abilities in the areas of language
learning.
<br>
<br><strong>SUPPORT Programme</strong>
<br>The EL Department runs both the MOE Reading Support Programmes such as
the Learning Support Programme (LSP), the School-based Dsylexia Reading
Programme (SDR) and the Reading Remediation Programme (RRP) as well as
our own Reading Support Programmes such as AM Read and PM Read. These programmes
are targeted intervention designed to support low progress readers in overcoming
reading challenges and achieving literacy success. These comprehensive
programmes provide individualised instruction, tailored to meet the learning
needs of each pupil by providing targeted support and evidence-based instruction.
Our reading programmes, empower low progress readers to overcome challenges,
achieve literacy success, and develop a lifelong love for reading.
<br>
<br><strong>BOOKS ALIVE!</strong>
<br>Books Alive! is a joyous event that ignites a passion for reading in our
pupils! The programme is a yearlong effort by the EL Department to enthuse
students to fall in love with reading through book sharing and culminates
on Books Alive! Day where pupils and staff come to school dressed as their
favourite character from a book they love. Through Books Alive!, we aim
for our pupils to share their passion for reading with others and at the
same time nurture confident, empathetic communicators. So, let the stories
come alive and the magic begin!</p>
