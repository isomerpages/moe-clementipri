<h4><strong>Key Programmes</strong></h4>
<p>
<br><strong>Recital@Recess</strong>
<br>Recital@Recess programme allows all Primary 4 to Primary 6 pupils to express
themselves and develop their technical skills in singing and instrumental
playing during their recesses. Beyond just a recital, it is a moment of
achievement and confidence building where pupils experience the thrill
of performing in front of an audience, gain valuable experience in stage
presence and collaboration with peers. It is also a platform for our pupils
to appreciate the arts.
<br>
<br><strong>SMURFs</strong>
<br>Music is an art form that requires both the conceptualisation and development
of ideas, as well as the ability to express those ideas through instruments
or voices. The SMURFs programme aims to develop Primary 1 and Primary 2
pupilsâ€™ potential in the areas of musical performance, musical interpretation
as well as musicianship. All Primary 1 and Primary 2 pupils are given the
opportunity to explore and express themselves confidently on the stage
through this platform. The programme contributes to the quality of their
holistic education and build self-esteem, nurture creativity, develops
concentration and confidence in them. It is an annual affair for our pupils
to demonstrate musicianship as an ensemble.
<br>
<br><strong>Ethnic Music Enrichment </strong>
<br>Ethnic music enrichment programme is designed to deepen young Primary
2 and 3 musicians' understanding and appreciation of world music during
curriulum. It enhance pupils' musical skills and broadening their exposure
to different culture and genre. Pupils get to respect and appreciate the
diversity within and between groups and communities. The programme emphasizes
collaboration and creativity, helping our pupils to grow both as musicians
and as individuals and continue to shape the world of musical styles and
contexts in Singapore and beyond.
<br>
<br><strong>Voices of Clementi (Singing Competition) </strong>
<br>Voices of Clementi is an exciting event that brings together Primary 3
and Primary 4 young vocalists to showcase their singing talents. The programme
typically features a diverse selection of songs, allowing pupils to demonstrate
their vocal range, technique, and ability to convey emotion through music.
This programme not only celebrates musical achievement but to encourage
pupils to build identities, develop a sense of belonging, push their boundaries,
gain confidence and learn from their peers in the pursuit of excellence.
<br>
<br><strong>Music Learning Journey</strong>
<br>Clementi Primary provides our Primary 5 pupils with a more holistic musical
learning experience to concerts of diverse musical offerings. Pupils are
able to have greater insights and cultivate greater appreciation of local
and global culture. Through this musical learning journey, we are able
to ignite the interest of pupils and extend their learning beyond classroom.
We are constantly searching for programmes that benefits our pupils.</p>
