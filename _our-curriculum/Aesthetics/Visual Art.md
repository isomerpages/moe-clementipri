<p>Vision:
<br><strong>Every Clementian is nurtured to be a creative and expressive individual through a comprehensive and engaging art education program that ignites curiosity, fosters imagination, and develops artistic skills, empowering them to explore their unique creative potential.</strong>

<h4><strong>Key Programmes</strong></h4>
<p><strong>Progressive Learning Experience</strong>
<br>Our art curriculum is structured to cater to different age groups, ensuring
a progressive learning experience. Starting with foundational skills in
drawing, painting, and crafting in the lower primary levels, pupils gradually
advance to more complex techniques such as printmaking, sculpture, and
digital art in the upper primary levels. This progression allows pupils
to build confidence and competence in various artistic forms.</p>
<p><strong>Diverse Artistic Exposure</strong>
<br>Our art programmes are designed to expose pupils to a wide range of artistic
styles, mediums, and cultural expressions. From traditional batik painting
and pottery to contemporary digital illustration and photography, pupils
are encouraged to explore and appreciate different forms of art. This exposure
not only enhances their creative skills but also broadens their understanding
of global cultures and histories.</p>
<p><strong>Participation in Local and National Art Competitions and Exhibitions </strong>
<br>Clementi Primary School encourages pupils to take part in local and national
art competitions and exhibitions. This not only provides a platform for
pupils to display their talents but also helps them gain valuable experience,
build confidence, and develop a sense of pride in their artistic achievements.</p>
