<p>Vision:</p>
<p><strong>CPS believes that every Clementian can and should be developed as a leader. As part of holistic education, we provide every student an opportunity to be a leader. Through Student Leadership Development, we envision that every Clementian is a leader who takes initiative to lead with confidence and integrity. </strong>
</p>
<p><strong>The school has put in place a tiered leadership structure to develop the leadership competencies of our student leaders. The tiered design of the approach caters to the implementation of various Student Leaders' Developent activities for different groups: specific segments of the population or the entire cohort . This differentiated approach ensures all pupils receive a baseline level of development while targeted training will stretch positional  leaders with role-specific skills.</strong>

<p>
<br>Tiered Approach</p>
<p>Tier 1 : Personal Leadership
<br>Tier 1 includes all Clementians. The focus is on developing in each and
every Clementian the core SE competencies and school values which form
the foundation for which all other actions are built, and guide them in
their daily actions.</p>
<p>Tier 2 : Task-Specific Leadership
<br>Tier 2 includes pupils who take on functional roles within the class or
that of supporting day-to-day events. The focus at this tier is to grow
their capacity to serve and lead with diligence and humility.</p>
<p>Leadership positions at this tier include:</p>
<p>• Class Monitors</p>
<p>• ICT Monitors</p>
<p>• ECO Leaders</p>
<p>• PE Leaders</p>
<p>• Art &amp; Craft Reps</p>
<p>• Music Reps</p>
<p>• Line Leaders</p>
<p>• Class Librarians</p>
<p>• Clementians on Patrol (COPS)</p>
<p>• Peer Support Leaders Junior (PSL Junior)</p>
<p>Pupils with strong leadership potential are then identified from this
tier to take on further roles in the next tier.</p>
