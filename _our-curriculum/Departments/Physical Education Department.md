<p>Vision:
<br><strong>Every Clementian developed to be physically competent and confident to enjoy a lifetime of active and healthy living safely and responsibly.</strong>
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In CTPS, our Physical Education (PE) programme offers Clementians a dynamic
and enriching curriculum, integrating both curriculum and co-curriculum
experiences. Our PE lessons are designed in accordance with the 2024 PE
Teaching Syllabus and incorporate thinking routines such as Look-Think-Do
and E21CC. To further develop students' game skills and promote good health
and safety practices, we organise a diverse range of progressive events
and programmes, with key highlights outlined below. Additionally, ongoing
assessment processes are in place to provide students with feedback on
their skill acquisition, contributing to the continuous improvement of
the teaching and learning experience.</p>
<h4><strong>Key Programmes</strong></h4>
<p><strong>Sportsmania (Lower Pri Sports Day)</strong>
<br>This annual sports day is a highlight for students from Pri 1 to Pri 3
as they can compete and represent their class in different games and sports
activities. The name Sportsmania is coined by the students from the three
levels. Through the station games and telematches, Clementians get to apply
their fundamental skills learnt during PE and develop SEL competencies.
This event also feature a Clementian-Teacher-Parent challenge where parents,
teachers and students are engaged in games replays that culminates fundamental
skills with and without manipulatives.</p>
<p><strong>Sports Carnival</strong>
<br>This is edition of annual sports experience for Clementians Pri to Pri
6. At the upper level, it is a carnival that features sports skills stations
and a team game segment for each level of students. This event not only
allows Clementians to apply the skills and games concepts learnt during
PE lessons but also provided opportunites for them to develop social emotional
skills and competencies as they work in teams. Parents and teachers are
also engaged in this event through a Parent-Teachers-Students Captain's
ball game which is a key highlight for the day.</p>
<p><strong>PAM Carnival</strong>
<br>The carnival collaborates with National Day celebrations and features
a suite of booths that expose students to games and activities beyond PE,
Art and Music lessons. In line with the National Day theme, these booths
are also closely associated with Singapore in thee 2h carnival period,
Clementians have the opportunity to engage in booths activities and a FTGP
package that build their understanding about Singapore.</p>
