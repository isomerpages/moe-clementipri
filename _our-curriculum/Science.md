<blockquote>
<p>Vision: Every Child enjoys science and values science as an important
tool in helping them explore their natural and physical world.</p>
<p>Every pupil is able to appreciate Science for its intrinsic value</p>
</blockquote>
<h4>Key Programmes</h4>
<p><strong>Inquiry based Science Lessons:</strong> For promotion of 21st CC
skills on Civic Literacy, Global Awareness and Cross-Cultural Skills (CGC),
lessons involved the students in the discussion of Science in the world
that they live in, to develop an awareness and ability to analyse global
issues and trends. For example, famous scientistsâ€™ contributions and science
technological advancements to the Science world are discussed at every
chapter. Environmental issues were also discussed during their science
lessons.</p>
<p>Critical and Inventive Thinking (CIT) skills were also taught during science
lab lessons to promote inquiry based learning and collaboration among all
students. Students are put into groups to work on an investigation. They
will use the lab inquiry lessons to use their communicative skills to do
reasoning of their investigation and make good decisions and conclusions
to their experimental designs and investigations. In this way, Communication,
Collaboration and Information Skills (CCI) are emphasised through the use
of science language to appreciate the use of Science standards in their
work.</p>
<p><strong>Claim, Evidence, Reasoning (CER):</strong> Strategies for open-ended
questions for pupils to have a scaffolding on how they can answer such
questions and hence be more confident in their answers.</p>
<p><strong>RICE (Read, Identify, Connect and Evaluate):</strong> Strategies
for MCQ to better equip the students on how they can answer their MCQ questions
all in their own and be confident in their answers.</p>
<p><strong>Alternative Assessment:</strong> The use of alternative assessment
to allow pupils to take ownership in their learning particularly in the
conduct of investigation to conclude a Science concept during weekly lab
work and Science Practical Tests</p>
