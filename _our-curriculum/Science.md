<br><strong>Every Clementian being empowered to love Science, discover its wonders and unlock its transformative power.</strong>

<h4><strong>Key Programmes</strong></h4>
<p><strong>Inquiry-based Science Lessons:</strong> For promotion of 21st CC
skills on Civic Literacy, Global Awareness and Cross-Cultural Skills (CGC),
lessons involved the pupils in the discussion of Science in the world that
they live in, to develop an awareness and ability to analyse global issues
and trends. For example, famous scientistsâ€™ contributions and Science technological
advancements to the Science world are discussed at every chapter. Environmental
issues were also discussed during their science lessons.</p>
<p>Critical and Inventive Thinking (CIT) skills were also taught during Science
lab lessons to promote inquiry based learning and collaboration among all
pupils. Pupils are put into groups to work on an investigation. They will
use the lab inquiry lessons to use their communicative skills to do reasoning
of their investigation and make good decisions and conclusions to their
experimental designs and investigations. In this way, Communication, Collaboration
and Information Skills (CCI) are emphasised through the use of Science
language to appreciate the use of Science standards in their work.</p>
<p><strong>Claim, Evidence, Reasoning (CER):</strong> Strategies that pupils
can adopt to excel in answering Open-Ended questions confidently.</p>
<p><strong>RICE (Read, Identify, Connect and Evaluate):</strong> Strategies
that pupils can adopt to excel in answering Multiple Choice Questions confidently.</p>
<p><strong>Alternative Assessment:</strong> Incorporating alternative assessments,
we foster pupil ownership, autonomy, and academic excellence in Science.
This innovative approach focuses on investigation skills during weekly
lab work and Science Practical Tests.</p>
