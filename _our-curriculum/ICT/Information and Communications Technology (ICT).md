<p><strong>Information &amp; Communications Technology (ICT)</strong>
</p>
<p>Clementi Primary School’s educational approach aligns with Singapore's
national educational strategies, specifically the <strong>EdTech Masterplan 2030</strong> and
the <strong>21st Century Competencies (21CC)</strong> framework. We strive
to use technology as a tool to cultivate independent, engaged learners
who are adept communicators and collaborators, equipped with essential
information literacy skills.</p>

<p><strong>Alignment with EdTech Masterplan 2030</strong>
</p>
<p>Our ICT programme supports the three key goals of Singapore's EdTech Masterplan
2030:</p>
<ol data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p><strong>Technology-Transformed Learning:</strong>&nbsp;Using technology
to create more engaging, personalised, and effective learning experiences</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Technology-Enabled School Operations:</strong>&nbsp;Leveraging
technology to improve administrative efficiency and data-driven decision
making</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Technology-Empowered Workforce:</strong>&nbsp;Developing both
students and educators with future-ready digital competencies</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>The core aim is to develop Clementians into:</p>
<ol data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p><strong>Active Learners:</strong> Students who take initiative and responsibility
for their own learning.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Caring Friends:</strong> Students who can work effectively with
others.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Compassionate Leaders:</strong> Students who demonstrate compassion
and leadership in digital spaces, using technology to serve others and
make positive contributions to their community.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>To achieve this, we are:</p>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p><strong>Integrating Educational Technology (EdTech):</strong> Making technology
a fundamental part of the curriculum and teaching methods.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Leveraging Information and Communication Technology (ICT):</strong> Using
ICT tools not just for content delivery, but specifically to foster key
21st Century Competencies, with a particular emphasis on:</p>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>Communication Skills</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Collaboration Skills</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Information Skills</p>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p></p>
<p><strong>Communication and Learning Platforms</strong>
</p>
<p><strong>MIMS (MOE Identity Management System):</strong> All students receive
a MIMS account essential for accessing academic applications and resources.</p>
<p><strong>Parents Gateway (PG):</strong> Primary communication channel accessible
via mobile app using Singpass.</p>
<p><strong>Student Learning Space (SLS):</strong> Key platform for assignments
and AI-enabled learning tools.</p>
<p><strong>Google Apps:</strong> Integrated learning tools accessible through
MIMS login.</p>
<p><strong>ClassDojo:</strong> Communication platform for classroom updates.</p>
<p><strong>&nbsp;</strong>
</p>
<p><strong>SLS as a Key Enabler of the EdTech Masterplan 2030</strong>
</p>
<p>The school taps on the Singapore Student Learning Space (SLS) V2 as a
key enabler in supporting the ICT curriculum. Digital literacy and AI literacy
lessons are hosted on SLS and the school will provide opportunities for
students to go through these lessons while integrating them within the
total curriculum.</p>
<p>Our teachers employ <strong>e-Pedagogy</strong> principles aligned with
the EdTech Masterplan 2030, focusing on:</p>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p><strong>Active Learning:</strong>&nbsp;Students engage with technology
as creators, not just consumers</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Collaborative Learning:</strong>&nbsp;Technology facilitates peer-to-peer
learning and group projects</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Self-Directed Learning:</strong>&nbsp;Digital tools enable students
to learn at their own pace and explore interests</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Personalised Learning</strong>
