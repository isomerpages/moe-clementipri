<p><strong>AI Literacy at Clementi Primary School</strong>
</p>
<p>Students will use GenAI to learn in an age-appropriate manner:</p>
<p>·&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Primary 1 to 3:&nbsp;Students will
mainly engage in hands-on experiences, with little or no direct use of
AI tools</p>
<p>·&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Primary 4 to 6:&nbsp;Students will
use AI tools occasionally with teacher supervision in class to support
their learning</p>
<p>Students will develop AI literacy throughout primary school under MOE's
National Digital Literacy Programme (NDLP), learning 9 digital competencies
under the Find, Think, Apply, Create (FTAC) Framework. Lower primary students
will learn to recognise that AI is present in our daily lives, while upper
primary students will learn about misinformation risks from AI output and
how AI features in SLS can support learning in a safe environment.</p>
