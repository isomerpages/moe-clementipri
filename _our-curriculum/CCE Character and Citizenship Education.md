<p>Learning Outcomes</p>
<p>To develop students as Informed, Concerned and Participative Citizens</p>
<p>Curriculum Approach</p>
<p>Children are naturally inquisitive and the inquiry approach aims to harness
this innate motivation in our students to inquire into things that catch
their attention. Inquiry helps our students learn to judge whether the
conclusions drawn by their peers are supported by sound information or
based on opinions. Through the inquiry process, students are also empowered
to be responsible for their own learning.</p>
<p>Syllabus</p>
<p>The syllabus is framed by knowledge, skills and values outcomes that pupils
will acquire in order to be informed, concerned and participative citizens
with a global outlook.</p>
<p>It is organised in three clusters:</p>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>Cluster 1 (Primary 1 &amp; 2): Discovering Self and Immediate Environment</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Cluster 2 (Primary 3 &amp; 4): Understanding Singapore in the Past and
Present</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Cluster 3 (Primary 5 &amp; 6): Appreciating the World and Region We Live</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Signature Programmes:</p>

<p><strong>5) Sexuality Education</strong>
</p>
<p>Sexuality Education (SEd) in schools aims to enable students to understand
the physiological, social and emotional changes they experience as they
mature, develop healthy and rewarding relationships including those with
members of the opposite sex, and make wise, informed and responsible decisions
on sexuality matters. SEd is premised on the importance of the family as
the basic unit of society. This means encouraging healthy, heterosexual
marriages and stable nuclear family units with extended family support.
The teaching and learning of SEd is based on respect for the values and
beliefs of the different ethnic and religious communities in Singapore
on sexuality issues.</p>
<p>2) The&nbsp;<strong>Goals</strong>&nbsp;of Sexuality Education are:</p>
<p>(a)&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Support students in managing
their physiological, social and emotional changes as they grow up and develop
safe and healthy relationships.</p>
<p>(b)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Guide students to make wise, informed
and responsible decisions on sexuality matters.</p>
<p>(c)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;Help students develop a moral compass
and respect for themselves and others by having positive mainstream values
and attitudes about sexuality that are premised on the family as the basic
unit of society.</p>
<p>3) The&nbsp;<strong>Key Messages</strong>&nbsp;of Sexuality Education
are:</p>
<p>(a)&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Love and respect yourself as
you love and respect others;</p>
<p>(b)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Build positive relationships based
on love and respect (which are the foundation for strong families);</p>
<p>(c)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Make responsible decisions for yourself,
your family and society; and</p>
<p>(d)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Abstinence before marriage is the best
protection against STIs/HIV and unintended pregnancies. Casual sex can
harm and hurt you and your loved ones.</p>

<p>5) The subjects that incorporate topics on sexuality include:</p>

<p>Character and Citizenship Education (CCE)</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Sexuality Education Lessons:</strong>
</p>
<p>6) The upper primary years mark the onset of puberty. With better nutrition
and improved health care, children are reaching puberty at a younger age
and have to grapple with physical, emotional and psychological changes
in themselves. The implication is that our children are becoming biologically
ready for sexual activity sooner without necessarily having the corresponding
cognitive or emotional maturity to modulate their behaviours. Furthermore,
our young are also exposed to a wide range of influences that could endanger
health and undermine the integrity of the family. Our students require
close guidance so that they can respond with discernment to the sexual
messages in the media and other sources.</p>
<p>7) Sexuality Education (SEd) lessons are taught as part of CCE (FTGP)
at Primary 5 and 6. In SEd, students will learn healthy ways to manage
the physiological, social and emotional changes in their growing years.
They learn to build healthy and rewarding relationships with others, including
those with members of the opposite sex. Students are also guided to make
wise, informed and responsible decisions to keep themselves safe from sexuality-related
risks.</p>

<p>8) Parents may opt their children out of Sexuality Education lessons,
