<p>Vision:
<br><strong>Every Clementian to be empowered and nurtured to be an informed, concerned and participative citizen competent in decision-making with an impassioned spirit to contribute responsibly to the society and world they live in.</strong>

<h4><strong>Key Programmes</strong></h4>
<p><strong>Inquiry-Based Learning</strong>
<br>Social Studies seeks to ignite pupils’ curiosity to inquire into real-world
issues that concern their lives. Through inquiry and authentic learning
experiences, Social Studies helps pupils to attain relevant knowledge and
understanding about these issues, develop critical and reflective thinking
skills, and appreciate multiple perspectives. Authentic learning experiences
also include field-based learning through learning journeys to heritage
museums and community spaces where pupils are able to conduct hands-on
exploration, construct new knowledge and make connections to the topic
being studied.
<br>
<br><strong>Alternative Assessment</strong>
<br>In Clementi Primary School, we carry out performance tasks as a form of
alternative assessment that would best reflect pupils’ ability to translate
and transfer key knowledge, skills and values in context. The performance
tasks are also designed to evoke the 21st Century Competencies of communication,
collaboration and information skills, critical and inventive thinking,
and civic literacy.
<br>
<br><strong>World Water Day</strong>
<br>World Water Day (WWD) is a key event run by the SS Department and the
National Education &amp; Social Studies (NESS) Ambassadors, one of Clementi
Primary School's Tier 3 Student Leader groups. WWD is a programme which
aims to raise awareness of the role of pupils in water conservation. Run
in March, NESS Ambassadors would carry out sharing sessions during assembly
and set up booths during recess to spread the message on the importance
of conserving water to the school population. Activities would also be
conducted during Social Studies lessons where pupils demonstrate their
understanding of the issue and contribute to the initiative.
<br>
<br><strong>National Education Events</strong>
<br>National Education (NE) Events are key events run by the CCE Department
and the National Education &amp; Social Studies (NESS) Ambassadors, one
of Clementi Primary School's Tier 3 Student Leader groups. NE events comprise
of Total Defence Day (TDD), International Friendship Day (IFD), Racial
Harmony Day (RHD) and National Day (ND). The commemoration of these key
events is to promote multicultural and social awareness among pupils and
contribute to efforts to nurture them into responsible citizens with the
sense of belonging, hope, reality and the will to act. Carried out across
the different times in the year, NESS Ambassadors would carry out sharing
sessions during assembly and set up booths during recess to spread the
message on the importance of commemorating NE events. They would come up
with information sharing through slides and activities like traditional
games to engage their peers, while putting across the NE messages.</p>
