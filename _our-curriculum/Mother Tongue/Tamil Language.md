<p><strong>Deepavali Celebration</strong>
<br>Each year, our Deepavali celebration is a vibrant and joyous event that
unites the entire school community. The program showcases a diverse range
of engaging activities, including traditional Indian instrumental and cultural
performances, as well as classroom-based Indian activities and crafts.
Pupils also take part in a fashion parade, proudly displaying their colourful
costumes. This event provides a wonderful opportunity for pupils to gain
insights into the festival and appreciate one another's traditions and
culture.</p>
<p><strong>Mother Tongue Language (MTL) Fortnight &amp; Language and Cultural Camp</strong>
<br>During Term 3, the Mother Tongue Department organised the Mother Tongue
Language Fortnight activities with the aim of creating a dynamic and enjoyable
learning environment for pupils to actively engage in and experience the
associated culture and customs. The activities included a diverse range
of experiences, from reciting nursery rhymes to painting clay lamps, learning
about the benefits of Indian spices, making murukku, puppetry, thoranam-tying,
basket weaving, and traditional games. These activities provided valuable
platforms for pupils to immerse themselves in our rich culture and develop
a deeper interest in learning more about our heritage. The fortnight activities
were instrumental in fostering the joy of learning the Tamil language and
understanding its traditions and heritage.</p>
