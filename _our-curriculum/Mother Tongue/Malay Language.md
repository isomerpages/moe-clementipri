<p>Vision: Proficient, confident and creative users of Malay language, with
strong moral values and deep sense of national identity, enabling them
to contribute meaningfully to society. (Arif Budiman)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Key Programmes</p>
<p><strong>1. Mother Tongue Fornight (MTL Fortnight)</strong>
<br>The Mother Tongue Language (MTL) Fortnight, held annually in Term 3, aims
to engage Clementians with learning experiences beyond the textbooks and
classrooms to make the learning of MTL fun and meaningful. Clementians
participate in various activities to immerse, better understand and appreciate
the Malay Language and culture. Our Clementians took part in the following
activities this year:</p>
<p>Primary 1: Playing batu seremban (five stones) and Singing of Malay folk
songs
<br>Primary 2: Playing congkak and Singing of Malay folk songs
<br>Primary 3: Making of Bunga Manggar
<br>Primary 4: Appreciation for Wayang Kulit and Malay tradisional music
<br>Primary 5: Batik Painting
<br>Primary 6: Khat Writing</p>
<p><strong>2. Fiesta Kampung</strong> 
<br>To further promote the use of the Malay Language and creating cultural
awareness in our Clementians, our school oganised the inaugural 'Fiesta
Kampung' event in 2024. A collaboration with other primary schools in the
W1 cluster, students from Primary 1 to 5 participated in various traditional
games such as bola baling, tapak gajah, capteh, sepak takraw and tarik
upih.</p>
<p><strong>3. External - Rakan Bahasa and Lensa Si Cilik</strong>
<br>As part of Bulan Bahasa, students are appointed as Rakan Bahasa (Friends
of the Language) by the Malay Language Council, Singapore (Majlis Bahasa
Melayu Singapura or MBMS), to encourage those who are passionate about
the Malay language and culture, to spread the love of the language to their
peers, friends and families. Their role is to share the beauty of the Malay
language and to continue promoting it.</p>
<p>Throughout the year, every Rakan Bahasa will be given opportunities to
attend various programmes and activities that will develop their skills
and capabilities. These programmes include Rakan Bahasa Kembara Activity
Cards, TeeVers Competition, Penterjemah Pintar (Translation Competition)
and more.</p>
<p>Lensa Si Cilik is a video competition where participants have to create
and film a skit based on Malay Language proverbs. Our school was awarded
the Gold award for our video submission.</p>
<p><strong>4. Teaching and Learning of the Malay Language</strong>
<br>In CTPS, our Clementians learn the Malay Language as active participants
in an ICT-enhanced learning environment. Clementians also get to embark
on learning beyond the textbooks and classrooms, making the learning of
Malay language more interesting and meaningful. They also learn about the
Malay culture in an interactive way through mediated learning experiences
and hand-on activities.</p>
