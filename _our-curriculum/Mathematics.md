<p>Vision:
<br>Empowering Clementians to be confident, self-directed learners with strong
mathematical foundations, critical thinking skills, and a passion for excellence.</p>
</blockquote>
<h4><strong>Key Programmes</strong><br></h4>
<p>The Mathematics Department is committed to fostering a community of self-directed
learners who excel in numeracy, logical reasoning, and problem-solving,
while nurturing a passion for meaningful contribution to society. Through
a dynamic and engaging curriculum, we aim to build students’ confidence
in mathematics, developing critical thinking skills essential for everyday
life and future learning.</p>
<p>To achieve this, our department employs a diverse range of pedagogical
approaches to make learning enjoyable and enriching. Our programmes are
thoughtfully designed to provide a solid foundation in numeracy from Primary
1 to 6, progressively advancing mathematical skills while fostering curiosity
and critical thinking. We cater to different learning needs, ensuring every
student is equipped with the tools for success in mathematics and beyond.</p>
<p>Some key programmes include:</p>
<p><strong>Learning Support for Mathematics (LSM) Programme</strong>
<br>The LSM Programme provides early intervention for Primary 1 to 4 students
who need help with basic numeracy skills. In small classes, trained teachers
offer individualised support to build students’ confidence and understanding
of mathematics. The programme aims to equip students with the skills to
learn alongside their peers and achieve age-appropriate math competencies.
Support is available for up to four years, with annual reviews to track
progress. Through varied, engaging activities, students develop positive
beliefs about their math abilities while covering the Primary Mathematics
syllabus.</p>
<p><strong>Math Olympiad Training Programme (MOTP)</strong>
<br>The MOTP provides opportunities for selected Primary 3 to 6 high achievers
in math to deepen their learning and foster their interest in the subject.
Students will be exposed to intellectually challenging and non-routine
math questions. Students develop confidence, perseverance, and advanced
problem-solving skills, equipping them for success in math competitions.</p>
<p><strong>Math Trail</strong>
<br>The Math Trail is a learning experience designed to bring math to life
in the everyday world. During Math Trail, Primary 1 to Primary 5 students
will embark on a journey around the school campus to explore and identify
mathematical concepts in their surroundings, making connections between
classroom learning and real-world applications. This interactive and engaging
experience encourages active learning, critical thinking, and problem-solving
skills, showcasing that math is alive in our school!</p>
<p><strong>Math and English Fiesta</strong>
<br>The Math and English Fiesta is a specially designed event aimed at engaging
Clementians in an immersive and enjoyable learning experience. As part
of our post-PSLE programme, Primary 6 students will develop and lead interactive
games and activities tailored to reinforce key Math and English concepts
for lower primary students. This initiative promotes peer collaboration,
teamwork, and socialisation among students across different levels, fostering
a supportive and inclusive learning environment.</p>
