<p><strong>Information &amp; Communications Technology (ICT)</strong>
</p>
<p>Clementi Primary School’s educational approach aligns with Singapore's
national educational strategies, specifically the <strong>EdTech Masterplan 2030</strong> and
the <strong>21st Century Competencies (21CC)</strong> framework. We strive
to use technology as a tool to cultivate independent, engaged learners
who are adept communicators and collaborators, equipped with essential
information literacy skills.</p>

<p><strong>Alignment with EdTech Masterplan 2030</strong>
</p>
<p>Our ICT programme supports the three key goals of Singapore's EdTech Masterplan
2030:</p>
