### PAL

#### Programmes for Active Learning (PAL) - P1 and P2

PAL provides a smooth transition for children from pre-school to primary education. With Primary 1 and 2 pupils in mind, PAL emphasises learning through hands-on experiences, having fun and enjoyment in the learning, and ongoing opportunities for peer interaction and self-discovery.

PAL aims to facilitate the well-rounded development of pupils in the five learning domains (cognitive, moral, social, aesthetics and physical) and help pupils to develop social emotional competencies.

In Clementi Primary School, all Primary 1 and 2 pupils undergo PAL modules as part of the holistic education during the curriculum time. PAL modules provide pupils with broad exposure in three areas-Performing and Visual Arts, Sports and Games and Outdoor Education.

##### Characteristics of PAL
In PAL, emphasis is placed on experiential learning. The hands-on experiences reinforce pupils’ learning, and allow them to explore, discover, generate further thinking and express their ideas. In every lesson, time is set aside for both individual work and team work. The activities are fun and enjoyable, and are pitched at the capabilities of Primary 1 & 2 pupils. Equally important in a PAL lesson is the time for pupils to reflect on their experiences and feelings in the different contexts set up for that lesson. As mentioned earlier, PAL provides an excellent platform for your child to acquire social and emotional competencies and inculcate good values.

##### PAL Learning Outcomes
Ultimately, PAL seeks to equip our pupils with life skills and dispositions for world of the future – that sense of confidence; the ability to express themselves effectively; the connection within themselves and with others, guided by a set of values.

With these dispositions and the content knowledge and skills of the other subjects in the school curriculum, our pupils will be set for the world of the future.
