<p>The <strong>crescent </strong>speaks of the pupils as a new generation
important to the survival of the nation in the future.</p>
<p>The school <strong>motto</strong> is portrayed as <strong>two persons</strong>,
the one in the front being of more significance than the other, emphasising
pupilsâ€™ willingness to be considerate and the preparedness to make personal
sacrifices by putting others before self in their actions.</p>
<p>The <strong>steps</strong> represent the school as an institution that provides
the opportunities for continuous improvement and growth in all aspects
of development of its pupils.</p>
<p>The <strong>inner smaller circle</strong> stands for the holistic education
to be provided.</p>
<p>This <strong>inner circle</strong>, together with the crescent moon, symbolises
a smiling face, helping to portray a happy learning environment that the
adults are committed to provide for the children.</p>
<p>The <strong>outer bigger circle</strong> is the symbol of strength, stability
and strength.</p>
