<p>School Song
<br>
<br>The Star of our future is shining bright
<br>Let us move hand in hand towards that light
<br>We will nurture our talents, develop our minds
<br>As we journey onwards and keep pace with time</p>
<p>Chorus:</p>
<p>Arise, Clementians, stand up tall and walk tall
<br>Be bold in our purpose, be kind to all
<br>Striving to excel, giving of our best
<br>Never fear or falter when we’re put to the test</p>
<p>In our work and play, we’ll help one another
<br>For under the heavens, we’re sisters and brothers
<br>So strengthen our bond, be united as one
<br>And make our CTP second to none</p>
