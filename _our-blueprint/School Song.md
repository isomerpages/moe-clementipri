<h4>School Song</h4>
<p>The Star of our future is shining bright
<br>Let us move hand in hand towards that light
<br>We will nurture our talents,
<br>develop our minds.
<br>As we journey onwards
<br>and keep pace with time:</p>
<p>Arise Clementians, stand up and walk tall.
<br>Be bold in our purpose, be kind to all
<br>Striving to excel, giving of our best
<br>Never fear or falter
<br>when we’re put to the test</p>
<p>In our work and play, we’ll help one another.
<br>For under the heavens,
<br>we’re sisters and brothers.
<br>So strengthen our bond, be united as one
<br>and make our C.T.P. second to none</p>
<p></p>
