<p>Dear Clementians, Staff, Parents, and Stakeholders,</p>
<p></p>
<p>Welcome back to the new academic year, 2025!</p>
<p>This year holds special significance, as we commemorate our school's Silver
Jubilee, 25 years of excellence, growth, and a legacy of empowering students
to reach their full potential.</p>
<p>As we begin this fresh chapter, I would like to acknowledge the many successes
of 2024. It was an outstanding year for our school, and I am proud to highlight
a few of our notable achievements.</p>
<p>Our Primary School Leaving Examination (PSLE) results were commendable,
and we celebrate the success of every student who took the examination,
recognising their diligence, dedication, and personal growth. Notably,
our graduating students' average PSLE score exceeded both the national
average and that of comparable schools, a testament to their efforts and
the guidance of our teachers.</p>
<p>I would like to express my heartfelt gratitude to our entire teaching
staff in providing a nurturing and engaging learning environment for all
our students. Your collective efforts, innovative approaches, and commitment
to excellence have had a positive impact on our students' academic success,
well-being, and overall growth.</p>
<p>Our non-teaching staff have been the unsung heroes of our school, providing
essential support and services that have enabled us to function seamlessly.
From maintaining our facilities to providing administrative support, your
contributions have been invaluable.</p>
<p>In the realm of sports, our students excelled in the National School Games
(NSG), demonstrating their passion, perseverance, and teamwork. Our coaches
and Physical Education teachers have done a marvellous job in guiding and
mentoring our students, and we are grateful for their expertise and enthusiasm.</p>
<p>Our students also sparkled on the artistic stage, delivering outstanding
performances at the Singapore Youth Festival. With creativity, poise, and
confidence, they made our school proud. We are grateful to our PAM teachers,
who have guided our students in unlocking their creative talents.</p>
<p>All these achievements were made possible by the collective efforts of
our students, teachers, non-teaching staff, and parents. I am thankful
for your partnership.</p>
<p>As we step into 2025, our commitment to excellence in every aspect of
school life remains unwavering. Guided by our vision, we strive to nurture
students who embody the qualities of Active Learners, Caring Friends, and
Compassionate Leaders.</p>
<p>Aligned with our school motto, "Others Before Self," we remain steadfast
in our commitment to our four core values: Perseverance, Integrity, Empathy,
and Respect. These values inspire us to navigate challenges with resilience,
act with integrity, demonstrate compassion and treat all individuals with
dignity and respect.</p>
<p></p>
<p>To our students, I encourage you to build on the successes of 2024 and
strive for even greater heights in 2025.</p>
<p></p>
<p>To our parents, I thank you for your ongoing support and partnership.
Your involvement in your child's education is invaluable, and we look forward
to working closely with you throughout the year.</p>
<p>To our staff, I express my appreciation for your hard work, dedication,
and commitment to excellence.</p>
<p>Let us start this new academic year with renewed spirit, guided by the
inspiring lyrics of our school song: "Let us arise, stand tall, and strive
for excellence, united as one."</p>
<p>Thank you.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Together, celebrating student agency,</p>
<p>Vimalenthiran Vijayasingam
