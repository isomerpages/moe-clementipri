<p>Dear Esteemed Clementi Primary School Students, Staff, Parents and Stakeholders,</p>
<p>I trust this message finds you well as we step into another academic year
filled with promise and potential. It is my pleasure to extend a warm welcome
to all our stakeholdersâ€”parents, teachers, students, and the wider community
that forms the backbone of Clementi Primary School.</p>
<p>I am thrilled to share with you the outstanding achievement of our students
in the 2023 Primary School Leaving Examination (PSLE). Our students have
once again demonstrated remarkable dedication, resilience, and academic
prowess, resulting in excellent PSLE results that we can all be immensely
proud of.</p>
<p>In 2023, our students showcased exceptional performance across various
subjects, reflecting the effectiveness of our holistic education approach.
The average PSLE score for our graduating students was well above comparable
schools and our National Average, a testament to the hard work and commitment
of both students and teachers.</p>
<p>These stellar results not only affirm the quality of education at Clementi
Primary School but also reflect our unwavering commitment to nurturing
well-rounded individuals who excel academically and embody our school vision
of "An active learner, a caring friend, a concerned citizen."</p>
<p>As we celebrate this achievement, it is essential to recognize that success
goes beyond academic excellence. Our students are not only scoring high
marks but are also developing the character traits and values encapsulated
in our school values of Perseverance, Integrity, Respect, and Excellence.</p>
<p>This remarkable accomplishment would not have been possible without the
collective efforts of our dedicated teaching staff, the support of parents,
and the commitment of our students. I extend my heartfelt gratitude to
each one of you for contributing to the success of Clementi Primary School.</p>
<p>As we embark on the new academic year, let us carry the momentum of this
success forward, inspiring our students to strive for even greater heights.
Our focus remains on providing a nurturing environment that fosters not
only academic excellence but also the holistic development of every child.</p>
<p>Here's to another year of achievements, growth, and collaborative success
at Clementi Primary School. Thank you for your ongoing support and dedication
to our shared vision.</p>
<p>Warm regards,</p>
<p>Vimalenthiran Vijayasingam</p>
<p>Principal Clementi Primary School</p>
