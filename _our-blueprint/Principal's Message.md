<p>A warm welcome to Clementi Primary School !</p>
<p>As I reflect on the remarkable achievements of 2025 and look ahead to
the promising year before us, my heart is filled with gratitude for the
extraordinary community that makes Clementi Primary School truly special.</p>
<p>I am delighted to share that our PSLE results for 2025 have been admirable,
reflecting not only our Clementians' hard work but also the support of
our parents and our entire school community. These achievements reflect
our collective commitment to nurturing well-rounded individuals who excel
both academically and in character.</p>
<p>At Clementi Primary School, we remain steadfast in our mission to develop
21st-century competencies in our students. Through our comprehensive curriculum,
we cultivate critical thinking, effective communication, collaboration
skills, and digital literacy. We prepare our students to be adaptable problem-solvers
and responsible global citizens who can thrive in an increasingly complex
and interconnected world.</p>
<p>A cornerstone of our educational philosophy is building student agency.
We believe that when students develop a strong sense of agency, they become
more engaged, motivated, and capable of navigating challenges with confidence
and resilience. Through student-led initiatives, collaborative projects,
and opportunities for voice and choice, we nurture independent thinkers
who are prepared to shape their own futures.</p>
<p>One of our greatest strengths is our Parent Support Group, which has grown
tremendously over the years and now functions as a vibrant ecology of care
and collaboration. Like interconnected elements in nature, our parents,
teachers, community partners, and dedicated staff work in harmony to create
an environment where every child can flourish. I am deeply grateful for
the continued support of our existing parent volunteers, whose dedication
and commitment have been instrumental in enriching our students' learning
experiences.</p>
<p>As we look to the future, I warmly invite more parents to join this thriving
ecosystem. Whether you have a few hours to spare monthly or can contribute
your professional expertise occasionally, every form of participation strengthens
our school community. We also extend this invitation to our alumni, who
carry with them the values and experiences gained during their formative
years at Clementi Primary. Whether through mentorship programmes, career
sharing sessions, or simply sharing your journey, your involvement helps
bridge the past with the present and future.</p>
<p>As we embark on 2026, I am filled with gratitude for the trust you place
in us and the dedication you show to your children's growth.</p>
<p>To our Clementians, remember that your achievements are built upon the
foundation of support from your families, teachers, and community. Carry
this spirit of gratitude forward as you continue to learn, grow, and contribute
positively to the world around you.</p>
<p>Together, let us make 2026 a year of continued excellence, meaningful
partnerships, and grateful hearts, always guided by our school motto: Others
Before Self.</p>
