### MOE Based Remediation

In 1992, MOE introduced the **Learning Support Programme (LSP)** in all primary schools. It is a specialised early intervention programme aimed at supporting pupils who enter Primary 1 with weak English language and literacy skills. Pupils are identified for LSP through a systematic screening process carried out at the beginning of Primary 1. The objective of the LSP is to equip pupils with basic literacy skills so that they could access learning in the regular classroom.

The LSP is implemented by qualified teachers appointed by their schools to be Learning Support Coordinators (LSCs). LSCs are given additional training by MOE HQ that equips them with specialised knowledge and skills to implement the programme. Pupils are supported daily for half an hour a day in groups of 8 to 10 pupils. Support continues in Primary 2.

In Clementi Primary School, the P3 pupils guide their P1 and P2 friends in reading during the morning Buddy Reading Programme. Pupils have given positive feedback regarding this programme. Here are some quotes from our P1 and P3 pupils:

* “I enjoy guiding the P1 pupils to read and learn new information.”
* “I love helping them read new words and improve their English and phonics.”
* “I enjoy learning new words.”
* “I love reading stories.”
* “I like reading with my buddies.”

The **Reading Remediation Programme (RRP)** is an additional literacy support programme implemented at Primary 3 and Primary 4 to support students with reading difficulties but who do not have dyslexia. The programme is carried out via 45-min sessions conducted twice a week by EL teachers.

The **School-based Dyslexia Remediation (SDR)** Programme is a specialised literacy remediation programme for Primary 3 and Primary 4 students with dyslexia. Students are identified for this programme through a systematic screening process for dyslexia conducted at the end of Primary 2. The programme aims to enable these students to become strategic decoders and spellers, flexible in the independent use of different strategies for reading, spelling and comprehension. Its objectives are two-fold: <br>
1) To equip students with reading and spelling strategies and skills to monitor their reading comprehension; and
2) To enable these students to internalize and use the strategies and skills through practice.
