### MOE Based Remediation


---------------------------------------------------------------------------
The&nbsp;**Reading Remediation Programme (RRP)**&nbsp;is an additional literacy support programme implemented at Primary 3 and Primary 4 to support students with reading difficulties but who do&nbsp;not&nbsp;have dyslexia. The programme is carried out via 45-min sessions conducted twice a week by EL teachers.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------
The&nbsp;**School-based Dyslexia Remediation (SDR)**&nbsp;Programme is a specialised literacy remediation programme for Primary 3 and Primary 4 students with dyslexia. Students are identified for this programme through a systematic screening process for dyslexia conducted at the end of Primary 2. The programme aims to enable these students to become strategic decoders and spellers, flexible in the independent use of different strategies for reading, spelling and comprehension. Its objectives are two-fold: <br>
1) To equip students with reading and spelling strategies and skills to monitor their reading comprehension; and
2) To enable these students to internalize and use the strategies and skills through practice.
