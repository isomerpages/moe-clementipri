### Enrichment
#### Enrichment Programme

The Enrichment Programme is an after-school programme designed to meet the learning needs of Primary 3, 4, 5 and 6 pupils who possess the aptitude as well as a keen interest in one or more of these subjects: English Language, Mathematics, Science and Mother Tongue Languages.

The Enrichment Programme aims to provide pupils with the opportunity to deepen their understanding of the subject, extend learning beyond what is covered in the syllabus and help pupils find meaningful links between the content or concepts learnt in a subject and everyday applications. All enrichment lessons are carefully selected and evaluated to ensure a high level of pupil engagement.

Pupils attending the Enrichment Programme would have the opportunity to learn beyond the classroom and develop many skills in a different context. Enrolment is by invitation based on recommendations by subject teachers and pupilsâ€™ overall results for the year.
