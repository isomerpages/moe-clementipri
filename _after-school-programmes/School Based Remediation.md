### School Based Remediation

#### Remediation Programme

The Remediation Programme is an after-school programme designed to meet the learning needs of Primary 3, 4, 5 and 6 learners who require additional support from their subject teachers in these subjects: English Language, Mathematics, Science and Mother Tongue Languages.

Recognising that these pupils would benefit from small-group arrangement, the Remediation Programme aims to provide flexibility for teachers to select and organise pupils in groups that would best suit their learning needs.

On top of the Remediation Programme held after school, all teachers also conduct High Frequency Short Duration (HFSD) sessions with selected pupils in the morning before assembly. These sessions aim to provide pupils with timely feedback on assignments or any work they have just completed.
