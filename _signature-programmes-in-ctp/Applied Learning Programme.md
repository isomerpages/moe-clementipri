### Applied Learning Programme
**Inspiring Thinking Tinkerers @Clementi Primary: An Interdisciplinary Approach to develop Critical and Inventive Thinking, Collaborative and Communication skills.**

The world which we live in today is characterised by rapid technological advancement, disruptions and unprecedented challenges. Clementi Primary School is committed to scaling up student-centric experiences to equip Clementians with the skills and attributes to thrive in the fast-changing world.

To this end, the school will adopt an interdisciplinary educational approach to learning, where Science, Technology, Engineering, Arts and Mathematics (STEAM) are incorporated to develop Clementians’ intellectual depth, critical and inventive thinking, collaborative and communication skills as well as dispositions for self-directed, lifelong learning. These skills and dispositions would be critical to prepare Clementians for real-world problems that are often ill-defined and multifaceted in nature, and that require an interdisciplinary approach to understanding and addressing them.

Our six-year ALP will enable Clementians apply these skills in systematic ways to solve real-world problems. Undergirding the programme is the Design Thinking (DT) framework – ‘Empathise’, ‘Define’, ‘Ideate’, ‘Prototype’ and ‘Test’. DT processes and structures will be deliberately incorporated in viable learning tasks across different subjects to develop Clementians’ problem-solving skills .

Over time, Clementians will learn to transfer and apply these skills across different contexts, analysing real-world problems, gather information, generate potential solutions, refine ideas and test solutions. We envision that through this programme, for all Clementians will become become empathetic, creative and critical problem solvers who regard errors as part of the learning process.

To ensure that all Clementians have opportunities to acquire and apply communication, collaboration, critical and inventive thinking skills in a meaningful and sustainable way throughout their six-year learning journey in school, the ALP is further divided into two tiers.

In short, Tier 1 programmes are foundational in nature that aim to develop the makers’ mindset and Tier 2 programmes aim to deepen Clementians’ application of these skills when they move beyond Primary 3.

To lay a strong foundation for lower primary Clementians (Primary 1 and Primary 2) to develop cognitive processes to assess options, evaluate credibility of content, make sound decisions, explore and think out of the box, the school will leverage English Language lessons and intentionally infused the teaching of critical and inventive thinking into content instruction. More resources will also be invested to help PAL teachers strengthen their pedagogical competencies to nurture Clementians’ socio-emotional competencies, collaboration and communication skills.

Having been exposed to critical thinking and inventive thinking skills in their lower primary years, all Primary 3 Clementians will undergo a ‘Social Studies and Art Design Thinking Challenge’ held during curriculum time as well as a ‘Design Thinking and EL Drama Programme’ held after school. The ‘Social Studies and Art Design Thinking Challenge’ and ‘Design Thinking and EL Drama Programme’ are designed to be relatable to Primary 3 Clementians and aim to develop greater empathy in them as they examine real-life issues. Through both programmes, Clementians will also develop other important 21CC skills such as collaborative and communication skills.

Having developed the foundational skills from Primary 1 to 3, at the upper primary levels from Primary 4 to 6, Clementians will be given opportunities to apply DT in project-based assignments across disciplines such as Social Studies, Art as well as Values in Action programme.

To complement level-based programmes, the school will conduct extension activities for all Clementians to deepen their understanding of DT. Clementians will apply DT through thoughtfully planned programmes and learning journeys that aim to trigger their curiosity and nurture their creativity. Examples of such extension activities include mass or level-targeted interdisciplinary themed programmes in the form of performances, skits and talks. Platforms such as recess performances on the library stage will also provide opportunities for Clementians to display their creative products and talent. In addition to the school’s Doodle Walls and Lego Corners, additional learning spaces like the Tinker Space also allow Clementians to express their creativity before, during and after school.
