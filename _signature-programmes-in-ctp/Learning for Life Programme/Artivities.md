# ARTivities

At Clementi Primary School, we believe that creativity is an essential component of education. We strive to incorporate artistic expression into our curriculum and school events as much as possible. 

ARTivities are collaborative art-making activities that are organized in conjunction with school events such as National Day. These activities aim to bring students together to create something beautiful and meaningful while also promoting teamwork and communication skills.

During these ARTivities sessions, students work in small groups to create a unique piece of art that reflects the theme of the event. The artwork may be displayed around the school or used as part of the event's decorations. We encourage students of all ages and artistic abilities to participate and express themselves creatively.

We believe that ARTivities not only help students develop their artistic skills but also provide an opportunity for them to bond with their classmates. It is a chance to work together towards a common goal and be proud of their collective achievement.

We are thrilled to have the ARTivities program as part of our school's cultural and creative offerings, and we look forward to seeing what our students can create together!
