The annual W1 schools art exhibition at Clementi Public Library, showcases the creativity and talents of our young artists from W1 schools. The exhibition features a diverse range of artworks, including paintings, sculptures, and mixed media pieces.

In conjunction with the exhibition, our W1 art teachers and students also conduct art workshops for library patrons. This workshop is a great opportunity for both children and adults to learn new techniques and explore their artistic potential. 

We believe that art is a valuable form of expression that should be accessible to everyone. By hosting the W1 schools art exhibition and conducting art workshops, we hope to inspire and encourage creativity among our community members. We invite everyone to visit the annual exhibition and participate in the workshop. We hope you enjoy seeing the amazing artwork that our young artists have created.
