# Kidstudio

KidStudio is our school’s multi-disciplinary gallery. This is where creativity and imagination come to life! KidStudio is a space dedicated to showcasing the talents of our students. With a wide range of students’ work from the various subjects, KidStudio is a vibrant and dynamic space that is sure to inspire and delight its visitors.

One of the hallmarks of our gallery is the diversity of the works on display. From paintings, drawings sculptures, poems, science projects, math games and installations, our students are encouraged to explore a wide range of holistic expressions. This approach not only fosters individual creativity but also allows for a more inclusive and representative representation of our school.

KidStudio is also committed to showcasing the work of local artists and professionals, providing a platform for the wider artistic community to share their work with our students and the wider community.  The traveling carts from National Gallery Singapore is an example of the school’s partnership with the broader artistic community. This provides our students a unique opportunity to see and learn from the work of professionals but also brings diverse perspectives and styles to our school.

KidStudio exhibits change regularly, with new students’ work from the various disciplines scheduled throughout the year. Whether it is a solo exhibition, group show, or a themed exhibit, each exhibit provides a unique opportunity to explore the richness and diversity of our students’ creative expressions. 
KidStudio is a welcoming and inclusive space that is open to everyone. We believe that art has the power to inspire and connect people from all walks of life, and we are committed to creating a space where every student, teacher and stakeholder feels welcome and valued.
