<p>Vision:<strong> Building an Active Community of Parent Volunteers</strong>
</p>
</blockquote>
<h4><strong>Key Programmes</strong></h4>
<p>1. <strong>Year-long Programmes</strong>
</p>
<p><strong><em>(a) Games@Recess </em></strong>
<br>During recess on Tuesdays and Thursdays, Clementians gather in at the
Talent Corner where a few tables are set up by our parent volunteers. At
these tables, lively groups of children are engrossed in a variety of board
games. The atmosphere is filled with laughter and chatter as they strategize,
roll dice, and move pieces across colorful game boards. Some pupils are
intensely focused on winning, while others cheer on their friends or offer
helpful advice. The mix of excitement and friendly competition creates
a vibrant, engaging environment, offering a refreshing break from their
usual routines. The occasional burst of laughter or a groan of mock frustration
adds to the playful ambiance, making recess a fun and interactive time
for everyone involved.</p>
<p><strong><em>(b) Craft@Recess</em></strong>
<br>The library stage area is abuzz with craft-lovers on Fridays during recess.
The scene is calm yet vibrant, as Clmentians work on their cross-stitch
projects under the careful supervision of our parent volunteers. Each child
has a piece of fabric stretched in a hoop, with colorful threads and needles
at the ready. The activity is a peaceful counterpoint to the usual recess
buzz in the canteen, providing a space for creativity and concentration.
Clementians get to chat about their designs, exchange ideas, and celebrate
each small achievement with a smile. The cross-stitching activity fosters
a sense of community and accomplishment, offering a calm and creative outlet
during the energetic break from class.</p>
<p><strong><em>(c) English Reading Club</em></strong>
<br>In a cozy corner of the school, the English Reading Club for weaker readers
is in full swing three days a week. Primary 4 Clementians, who act as mentors,
are seated with their younger peers around a table adorned with colorful
picture books and engaging chapter books. The session is warm and inviting,
filled with gentle encouragement and patient explanations. Older pupils
read aloud with expressive intonation, modeling fluent reading and making
the stories come alive. They pause to ask questions, discuss illustrations,
and ensure that each younger reader understands the content, fostering
an interactive and supportive learning environment.</p>
<p><strong>2. Annual Events/Activities</strong>
<br>Our Parent Support Group (PSG) plays a crucial role in supporting a variety
of annual events and activities within the school, enhancing the overall
educational experience for pupils. Here’s a snapshot of the key events
and how the PSG contributes to each:</p>
<p>Teachers' Day &amp; Children's Day Celebration: The PSG take time off
their busy schedules to put up performances for the celebrations' live
concerts.</p>
<p>Learning Journeys: The PSG helps to coordinate field trips and educational
learning journeys, ensuring that logistics run smoothly and that pupils
get the most out of these immersive learning experiences. They assist with
chaperoning and providing additional support to make the journeys enjoyable
and enriching.</p>
<p>Swimsafer Programme: For the Swimsafer programme, which focuses on teaching
pupils essential swimming and water safety skills, the PSG is involved
in facilitating communication between parents and the school. They may
help with organizing practice sessions, arranging transportation, and ensuring
that all necessary resources are in place for a successful program.</p>
<p>Shell Traffic Games: This initiative aims to educate pupils about road
safety through interactive games and activities. The PSG supports this
event by helping set up the games, managing stations, and engaging with
pupils to reinforce the importance of traffic safety in a fun and educational
manner.</p>
<p>CCA Events: Co-curricular activities (CCAs) are an integral part of pupil
life, and the PSG contributes by organizing events such as showcases, competitions,
and performances. They help coordinate logistics, recruit volunteers, and
provide support to ensure that CCA events are well-executed and enjoyable
for all participants.</p>
<p>Through these efforts, the PSG enhances the quality of educational experiences,
supports pupil development, and fosters a strong sense of community within
the school. Their involvement ensures that these events are not only successful
but also create lasting positive impacts on pupils and their families.</p>
<p><strong>3. Care Packs for Primary 6 Clementians</strong>
</p>
<p>As our Primary 6 pupils have been working hard all year, PSG@CTPS wanted
to present them with something to encourage them and remind them that they
are loved. As this is the first time this is being done, PSG sought feedback
from P6 parents on suitable items to put together in a “P6 Care Pack”.</p>
<p>Based on that, PSG decided on the following:</p>
<p>1. Exam-Grade Stationery – Blue Ball-point Pen, 2B Pencil and Eraser
<br>2. Comfort food – Hot Chocolate sachets and Rainbow Cookies
<br>3. Personalised Keychain
<br>4. Motivational Stickers</p>
<p>Following this, a group of 25 parents – P6 parents and PSG members – came
together to pack these items into colourful bags and label every single
bag with handwritten names on a specially designed tag. As they approach
the final lap of their PSLE journey, we hope our Primary 6 pupils feel
motivated to stay calm and do their best!</p>
