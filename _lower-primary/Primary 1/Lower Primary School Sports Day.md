### Lower Primary School Sports Day
#### P1 At The Courtyard
Our Sports and CCA leaders personifies the school motto of "Others Before Self" by organising the activities for the Lower Primary Sports Day P1 segment. The stations manned by these leaders not only afford our P1 Clementians the opportunity to experience the sports and games planned for them, it also allows parents to join their children as participants and bond over physical activity in a carnival-like atmosphere.
