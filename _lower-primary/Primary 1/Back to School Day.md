### Back To School Day
As part of our efforts to strengthen home-school partnerships, the school invites parents/guardians to our “Back to School” Day, providing an opportunity for parents to meet their child’s/ ward’s Form Teachers, and find out how well their child/ward is settling in primary school. Held at the end of January, during the networking session, Form Teachers will share on matters such as class routines, setting of learning targets and expectations. Parents/guardians will also get to interact with the subject teachers as well as other parents. Parents will also be given time to have recess with their child/ward, attend lessons with them and attend a parenting talk by _‘Family_ _Matters @ School’._
