### Learning Journey
As part of the Social Studies Learning Framework and Approach to discover self and the immediate environment, our P1 Clementians went on a learning journey around the neighbourhood. Students are expected to articulate the importance of different places within their neighbourhood and how it affects the way different groups of people live within the community. Tapping on inferential, critical thinking and life skills, our P1 Clementians participate in a neighbourhood trail and visited places such as the Chinese Medicine Hall, family clinic, a self-service laundromat, a bakery, a sewing and embroidery specialist, a mini mart as well as public spaces like the pavilion, playground and exercise corner.
