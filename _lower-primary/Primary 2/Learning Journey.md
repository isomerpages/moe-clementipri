### Learning Journey
A follow-up to the P1 Social Studies Learning Framework and Approach to discover self and the immediate environment, our P2 Clementians continued on a learning journey to discover neighbourhood – this time at Clementi Town Centre. Students are expected to articulate the importance of having different communities in Singapore – where through shared experiences in our community, unites us as people of Singapore. Tapping on inferential, critical thinking and life skills, our P2 Clementians participate in a neighbourhood trail and visited places such as the Clementi Bus Interchange, Musang King Fruits Stall, a household shop, a pawn shop, the Clementi market and food centre as well as the buzz kiosk.
