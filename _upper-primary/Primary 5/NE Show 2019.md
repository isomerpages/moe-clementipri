### NE Show 2019
It is an annual affair for our P5 Clementians to be invited to attend the National Education Show, which is essentially a preview of the National Day Parade. This year, the theme for NDP 2019 is “Our Singapore”, which commemorates our Singapore bicentennial and allows us to tell Our Singapore story from past to present. “Our” emphasises the collective ownership of Singapore. We are living the dreams of our pioneers, and we are now the pioneers of our future.

Through the NE Show, we hope our Clementians are inspired to look towards the future with hope and that the experience of waving flags, singing their favourite NDP songs and watching spectacular fireworks display, has created lasting memories for them!
