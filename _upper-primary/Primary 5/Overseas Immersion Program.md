### Overseas Immersion Program
The Overseas Immersion Programme (OIP) is a signature programme of the Mother Tongue Languages (MTL) department. Through the interactions with the people in the regional countries, the participants will appreciate the cultural similarities and differences between Singapore and our regional neighbours, thus developing their global awareness and cross-cultural skills and sensitivities. Chaperoned by our teachers, the participants will be immersed in local schools where they will interact with the pupils and experience classroom learning. They will also visit cultural and historical sites to enrich their understanding of the local culture and history.
