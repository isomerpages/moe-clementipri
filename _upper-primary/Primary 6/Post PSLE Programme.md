### Post-PSLE Programme
After the Primary School Leaving Examination (PSLE), our students at Clementi Primary School participate in art enrichment activities as part of the post-PSLE programmes.Â  The art enrichment offers a range of engaging activities such as caricature and digital photography.

Through the digital photography workshop, for example, students learn to use iPads and editing software to create stunning photographs. They also gain a better understanding of the principles of composition and lighting, which can help them in their future artistic endeavors.

Overall, the post-PSLE programme at Clementi Primary School provides a valuable opportunity for our students to explore their artistic talents and develop new skills. By participating in these workshops, our students are better prepared to pursue their passions and succeed in their academic and personal lives.
