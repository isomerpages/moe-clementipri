### Post-PSLE Programme
The Post-PSLE Programme is designed to develop leadership and collaborative skill, and to give opportunities to our Clementians to explore their talent and potential on areas that are beyond the textbooks.

The activities planned are aligned to meet the following objectives:
*  To support our P6 Clementians in the transition process to Secondary Schools; and
*  As part of our holistic programme to develop our P6 Clementians in the moral, intellectual, physical, socio-emotional and aesthetics domains

Every week is aligned to one particular domain, and our Clementians truly showed lived out our schoolâ€™s vision of being a keen learner with their spirit of life-long learning!

They went to Kidzania Singapore, participated in a race at Gardens by the Bay, picked up STOMP Percussion and Batik Art skills, did their Values-in-Action project and bonded through Dragon-Boating!

All these while working together as a class for their graduation performance for their P6 Graduation!

Let the photos speak for their enthusiasm!
