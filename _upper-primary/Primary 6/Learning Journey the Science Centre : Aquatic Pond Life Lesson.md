### Learning Journey to the Science Centre: Aquatic Pond Life Lesson
Every year, Clementians from every level from P3 to P5 will visit the Singapore Science Centre and be engaged in the lessons, which are carefully chosen from the Science Centreâ€™s list of activities available. Clementians are able to have a lot of hands-on experience as they take part in the lessons, which are carefully prepared and taught by the resident trainers of the Singapore Science Centre. It is through these experiences that the Clementians will be able to better understand science concepts which are taught in school. Our P6 Clementians always enjoy their trip to the Science Centre as they learn more about the topic on the diversity of organisms in the pond, which is covered in their school syllabus.
