### Study Skills and Self Management Workshop
To gear our P6 Clementians up for their PSLE, we brought in professional coaches from Singapore Learning Mind to guide our Clementians to success. They were taught Mind-Mapping and Note-Taking skills for more effective study strategies. They were also taught goal-setting and time-management skills to better organize themselves and curb habits that could hinder success!
