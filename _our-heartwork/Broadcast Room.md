<p>In our aim of developing our Clementians as confident and empathetic communicators,
the broadcast room serves as a hub for disseminating information during
morning assemblies, fostering community and providing valuable educational
experiences. The broadcast room offers students practical experience in
media and learn valuable skills in broadcasting, editing, and production,
which can be beneficial for future careers.</p>
