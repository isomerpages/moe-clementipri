<h4><strong>Key Programmes</strong></h4>
<p><strong>Creative and inventive thinking</strong>
<br>To build a strong foundation for lower primary pupils in developing cognitive
processes that will enable them to assess options, evaluate the credibility
of content, make sound decisions, and think critically, the school has
leveraged English Language lessons in Primary 1 and Primary 2 to intentionally
infuse the teaching of creative and inventive thinking into content instruction.
Through the STELLAR programme, thinking skills are integrated to provide
pupils with opportunities to collaborate and communicate their thought
processes effectively.</p>
<p><strong>Fundamentals to Design Thinking</strong>
<br>Design Thinking framework is introduced to our middle primary pupils to
help them understand how it can be applied to solve problems. All Primary
3 pupils will participate in a four-day “Design Thinking Workshop” to familiarize
themselves with the framework and its practical application. During the
workshop, they will explore how Design Thinking can be used to address
real-life problems they encounter at school or home. This application is
further reinforced through interdisciplinary work, where pupils examine
issues related to plastics and the environment. In Primary 4, pupils will
take part in the “Art Design Thinking Challenge,” where they will collaborate
to solve real-life problems using art as a medium of expression.</p>
<p><strong>Application of Design Thinking to real-world challenges</strong> 
<br>By the upper primary level, pupils are more familiar with Design Thinking
and are tasked with applying it to real-world challenges. For instance,
our Primary 5 pupils will explore food security and engage with the farm-to-table-to-waste
cycle, gaining awareness of food waste and management. By linking Science
concepts learned in class with Design Thinking processes, they will propose
solutions to real-life food security issues in Singapore. Our Primary 6
pupils will integrate Design Thinking with the entrepreneurship programme
to develop a values-in-action project, using the deisgn thinking framework
as a tool for innovation and social impact.</p>
<p><strong>Enriched and deepen Clementians’ application of Design Thinking</strong>
<br>Selected pupils in the E2K Mathematics and Science programme undergo a
ten-week course where they are challenged to develop their own project
using the Design Thinking framework, with a focus on the key phase, "Empathise."
This process emphasises the importance of generating a holistic and empathetic
understanding of the problems people face. As part of the programme, pupils
are tasked with observing and identifying issues or challenges they wish
to address in order to help their family, friends, or others find meaningful
solutions.</p>
<p><strong>CTPS Rocket Week!</strong>
<br>Launched in 2024, Rocket Week is a five-day programme that serves as a
platform to integrate the Applied Learning Programme (ALP) with various
subjects, aligning with 21st-century competencies. It provides pupils with
unique learning experiences beyond the classroom through hands-on learning
journeys across Singapore, skills-based workshops, and group tasks. The
programmes are designed to be thematic, with age-appropriate activities
tailored to pupils' abilities and competencies. These activities deepen
their understanding of the curriculum while developing critical thinking,
problem-solving, and communication skills. The programme also emphasizes
collaboration, encouraging teamwork, conflict resolution, and the ability
to leverage individual strengths.</p>
