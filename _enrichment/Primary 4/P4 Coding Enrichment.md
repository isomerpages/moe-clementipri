### P4 Coding Enrichment
The P4 Coding enrichment programme allows pupils to learn how to write codes into micro:bit to perform functions. Clementians will be exposed to see how micro:bit can be used to make simple applications in their daily lives. Through the hands-on sessions, pupils will learn creative problem-solving skills using science and technology.
