### Drone Workshop
Some P6 Clementians are selected to participate in the Drone enrichment workshop during the June holidays. Through the workshop, they are able to have a good experience learning how to code the drones to execute movements and complete the challenge posed to them. They also learn how to apply their knowledge of Mathematics and Science subjects through the learning process, and have lots of fun too!
