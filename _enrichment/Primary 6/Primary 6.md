### Primary 6
The Science Department believes that the best way for kids to fully understand a scientific concept is through play and hands-on activities. Science enrichment for all levels are carefully curated for our Clementians which aims to ignite creativity and interest in Science and to make connections for the Clementians on why the learning of science is everywhere around us. With the new focus of STEM (Science, Technology, Engineering, Mathematics), our P5 to P6 Clementians participate in STEM related enrichments through the years to provide strong Science fundamentals for Clementians to innovate and pursue STEM for future learning and work.

### Drone Workshop
Some P6 Clementians are selected to participate in the Drone enrichment workshop during the June holidays. Through the workshop, they are able to have a good experience learning how to code the drones to execute movements and complete the challenge posed to them. They also learn how to apply their knowledge of Mathematics and Science subjects through the learning process, and have lots of fun too!
