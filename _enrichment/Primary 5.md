### Primary 5

The Science Department believes that the best way for kids to fully understand a scientific concept is through play and hands-on activities. Science enrichment for all levels are carefully curated for our Clementians which aims to ignite creativity and interest in Science and to make connections for the Clementians on why the learning of science is everywhere around us. With the new focus of STEM (Science, Technology, Engineering, Mathematics), our P5 to P6 Clementians participate in STEM related enrichments through the years to provide strong Science fundamentals for Clementians to innovate and pursue STEM for future learning and work.
