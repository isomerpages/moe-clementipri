### Science Terrarium Enrichment

#### P3 Science Enrichment: Terrarium Making and Mushroom Growing

Our P3 Clementians participate in hands-on enrichment that introduces to the diversity of organisms around them. Clementians learn about the basics of terrarium making and the science behind its self-sustaining ecosystem that allows them to thrive in Singapore. They will gain knowledge of different types of plants and fungi and how they interact with the Earthâ€™s water cycle. Clementians also learn to take care of the terrarium and grow mushrooms in their classrooms and make meaningful observations from taking care of these organisms.
