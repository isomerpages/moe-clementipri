### Chinese Theatre Arts Enrichment Programme

#### Learn Through Play

To enhance their interest in learning the Chinese Language and to build their confidence in a range of communicative activities, Clementians participate in the Chinese Theatre Arts Enrichment Programme: Learn through Play. They explore creative roles through drama to improve their communication skills such as expressiveness and articulation, while developing their imagination, self-awareness and social skills. At the end of the programme, all budding performers will put up a group performance to put what they have learnt to the test.

### P3 Oral Communication Programme

#### P3 Oral Communication Enrichment Workshop

Our P3 pupils had the opportunity to learn techniques for speaking confidently to different audiences for different purposes, through the P3 Oral Communication Enrichment Workshop. Skills and knowledge for effective oral communication were taught through discussion-based and experiential learning. Coping strategies for fears related to communication were taught so that pupils learn how they could deal with stage fright and how to calm their nerves when speaking in front of an audience. They were also introduced to the art of thinking on their feet, to engage in impromptu conversations with others. Through this workshop, pupils not only extended their learning of oracy, but also developed greater self-awareness and socio-emotional competencies.

Here are some things that our pupils said about the workshop:
* “I learnt to speak more clearly and more loudly. I also learnt that you need to be loud to be a good speaker. If you are loud, you will be able to make audience more interested in your speech.” (Kyal sin)
* “I learnt how to make my speeches interesting.” (Krishav)
* “I learnt how to speak in a better way.” (Ranon)
* “I learnt to be confident and improve my speech.” (Angel)
* “I learnt to be more confident and not be shy.” (Grace)
