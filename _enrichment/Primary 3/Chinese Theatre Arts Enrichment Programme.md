### Chinese Theatre Arts Enrichment Programme

#### Learn Through Play

To enhance their interest in learning the Chinese Language and to build their confidence in a range of communicative activities, Clementians participate in the Chinese Theatre Arts Enrichment Programme: Learn through Play. They explore creative roles through drama to improve their communication skills such as expressiveness and articulation, while developing their imagination, self-awareness and social skills. At the end of the programme, all budding performers will put up a group performance to put what they have learnt to the test.
