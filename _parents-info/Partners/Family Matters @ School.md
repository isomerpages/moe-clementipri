### Family Matters@School

Clementi Primary has partnered Ministry of Social and Family Development (MSF) to enhance the quality of family life through Family Matters @ School programmes. A wide series of Family Matters @ School programmes ranging from parenting talks and workshops to parent-child bonding activities and social events are planned and organised throughout the year to equip parents with knowledge and skills to enrich their family life and foster positive family relationships.

If you would like to receive email/SMS notifications of any upcoming programme, you could email our FamilyMatters@ School Coordinator, Mr Zahid Bin Abdul Aziz atÂ [cps.familymatters@gmail.com](mailto:cps.familymatters@gmail.com)
