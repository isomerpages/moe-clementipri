### Edusave Awards for Primary School

Edusave Awards are given by the government annually to Singaporeans pupils to help equalize educational opportunities and motivate pupils to excel in schools. These Singaporean pupils must have performed well or made good progress in their school work and must have good conduct. The Edusave Awards for Achievement, Good Leadership and Service (EAGLES) is awarded to recognize pupil’s leadership qualities, services rendered to the school and the community, and excellence in non-academic activities. In 2012, the Edusave Character Award (ECHA Award) was introduced and serves to recognize and affirm pupils who demonstrated exemplary character and outstanding personal qualities through their behaviour and activities.
