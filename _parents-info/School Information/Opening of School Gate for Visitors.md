<h3>Opening of School Gate for Visitors</h3>
<p>The main school gate is open from 6.30 a.m. to 7.30 a.m. to allow parents
who drive to drop off their children in the morning. Parents picking up
their children after dismissal can park their vehicles at Block 435 or
Clementi Cascadia and wait for them outside the school gate.</p>
