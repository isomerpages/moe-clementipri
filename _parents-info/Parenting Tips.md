### Cyberwellness

The school uses the MOE cyber wellness framework to develop Clementians’ instinct to protect and empower Clementians to take responsibility for their own well-being in cyberspace. The three principles, ‘Respect for Self and Others’, ‘Safe and Responsible Use’ and ‘Positive Peer Influence’ when adhered to will anchor Clementians’ well-being in cyberspace as Clementians will then be able to make careful and well-considered decisions.
