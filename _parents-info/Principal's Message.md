At Clementi Primary School, “Why we do what we do?” is always a question that we encourage everyone to ask. This questioning mindset is what we encourage all to continually ask. This knowledge of our environment is very important.  So, pupils, staff and stakeholders must always know how the school can help everyone connected with it to grow and develop into useful citizens of Singapore. 

To prepare pupils for an increasingly globalized and interconnected world with rapid technological changes, Clementi Primary School has taken a balanced and holistic approach in providing a sound academic foundation in literacy and numeracy that integrates life skills and the building of character. The customised school curriculum focuses on nurturing curiosity for pupils to continue learning throughout their lives, building confidence to deal with changes and improving abilities to communicate and collaborate with people of different cultures and nationalities. Pupils are given a holistic approach to education, with a wide range of wonderful and interesting lessons, enrichment activities and events.  This allows them to explore and discover their interests and talents over a wide range of disciplines, thus providing them with a broad and deep foundation for their lifelong journey.

Pupils are also given ample opportunities to express themselves creatively, physically and artistically. The various platforms offered to them at all levels seek to bring out the innate and learnt skills in all our pupils. We also offer a 6 year leadership programme that seeks to build personal and team leadership for all our pupils.  With the commitment of providing our pupils with a holistic education, we want them to reach their full potential academically, physically, socially and emotionally.

Staff at Clementi Primary School(CTPS) have a few maxims by which our culture is defined. Firstly, we love our pupils first, then we teach them. The core ethos we hold is that we must consider our pupils as our very own children and thus set the tone as to how we will take care and educate them for the time that they are in CTPS. We believe that every child has the ability to learn and grow and with the proper love and care, this will be achieved. This is our caring culture. 

Next, our team of dedicated and committed staff who have an attitude of excellence, work tirelessly to enrich the lives of our pupils and engage them in their learning. They strive to develop a love for learning in every child, as that is the key for success in life. Our staff - from allied educators and teachers to our executive administrative staff, have a strong sense of mission which is to maximise the potential of all our Clementians. With values and lifelong skills infused in our lessons and co-curricular activities, our pupils are able to discover their interests and unique strengths and are motivated to continually grow. When you walk through our corridors and hall, the abundant energy and constructive noise bear testimony to the fact that our pupils enjoy a positive school experience and look forward to coming to school every day.

Finally, we believe that partnerships must be the foundation for the growth of our pupils. School and home partnerships are of paramount importance to us and we actively seek out parent engagement opportunities. We are heartened that we have many supportive parents who step forward and get involved in the various activities and programmes that the school organises. As we move ahead, we would like to continue to forge these collaborative partnerships with parents so that the academic and character development of our pupils can be further enhanced. When the School and Home are in sync, only then will the child benefit with a constant and clear communication of values and knowledge.

Our achievements in the past 2 years, since coming out of the COVID period have been heart-warming. Our PSLE results have improved tremendously, and we share this joy with you. We have done better than our benchmarked comparable schools and it is the result of the hard work put in by the staff and stakeholders of the school. Our quest for holistic education remains on track and we hope to share with all of you many more such achievements by the school. Let us all continue to make CTPS a great school for your child’s educational foundation.


Thank You

Yours in Service, <br>
