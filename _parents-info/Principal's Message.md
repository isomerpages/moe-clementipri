A very warm welcome to the School Year for 2021.

The past year has been tough for all of us and we look forward to a new year filled with hope and new aspirations. I am Mr Vimalenthiran Vijayasingam and will be honoured to take care of your children together with the staff of Clementi Primary School. I believe in this tenet that we will love your children first, then we will educate them. Nothing matters more than a good upbringing with love and values at the core. We hope to provide this for all Clementians and will work hard to ensure that we do.

The school has been progressing well and has celebrated its 20th anniversary last year. I am sure that with your partnership, the school will achieve even greater heights. We will continue to provide a good foundation for our Clementians, nurturing them to be useful citizens for the future. We earnestly look forward to your continued partnership in nurturing our Clementians. We believe that partnerships must be the foundation for the growth of our students. School and Home partnerships are of paramount importance to us and we actively seek out parent engagement opportunities. We welcome active participation in all our events and showcases. We also value the follow-up done by our parents when the students return home. When the School and Home are in sync, then the student will truly benefit with a constant and clear communication of values and knowledge.

I hope to get to know all of you in due course and I look forward to interacting with you when the opportunities arise. Let us work together to bring about greater glory to the school and make school a place that our children are happy to come to everyday. School should be a place where our children feel loved, feel safe and feel excited. It is a haven where they should be nurtured, valued and loved for who they are. It should be a place where their potential should be maximized and their talents recognized. Clementi Primary School has been providing this for your children and will continue to do so.

I wish all of you the best for 2021 on behalf of our staff and stakeholders. Let us look forward to a great year!

Thank You

Yours in Service, <br>
Vimalenthiran Vijayasingam
