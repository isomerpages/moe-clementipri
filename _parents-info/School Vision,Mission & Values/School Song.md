### School Song

The Star of our future is shining bright <br>
Let us move hand in hand towards that light<br>
We will nurture our talents,<br>
develop our minds.<br>
As we journey onwards<br>
and keep pace with time:<br>

Arise Clementians, stand up and walk tall.<br>
Be bold in our purpose, be kind to all<br>
Striving to excel, giving of our best<br>
Never fear or falter<br>
when we're put to the test<br>

In our work and play, we'll help one another.<br>
For under the heavens,<br>
we're sisters and brothers.<br>
So strengthen our bond, be united as one<br>
and make our C.T.P. second to none<br>
