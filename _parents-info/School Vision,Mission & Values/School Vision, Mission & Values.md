### School Vision, Mission & Values

#### Our Vision
**An Active Learner. A Caring Friend. A Compassionate Leader**

The school's current Vision of "A Leader. A Keen Learner. A Friend." continues to be relevant for the next phase of our school's development. However, to prepare Clementians to thrive in today's VUCA world and the uncertain future, the adjectives "active", "caring" and "compassionate" are added to the current VMV to qualify the kind of learner, friend and leader we aspire our Clementians to be. These adjective also provide refinement to the direction of our school's efforts to nurture our students. Our revised Vision is "An Active Learner. A Caring Friend. A Compassionate Leader."

#### Our Mission
A community of self-directed learners who strive for excellence and are active contributors with a passion to serve

In an environment marked by accelerated technological changes and knowledge becoming obsolete at an ever increasing pace, it is important that we ensure that our students are self-directed and future ready. Clementians would take ownership to assess their learning needs, set S.M.A.R.T goals, identify necessary resources, adopt appropriate strategies and evaluate their learning outcomes.

Learning is a social process. We envision Clementians to be learning alongside one another, collaborating to solve problems, developing their critical thinking skills and communicating effectively and respectfully. Within this nurturing and enabling environment, Clementians would strive to be the best version of themselves, meeting and overcoming challenges with a positive attitude. It is crucial that in all their endeavours, Clementians are guided by a sound moral compass and are discerning in judgment. As they strive for personal excellence, we hope they care for others in the community and possess the will to act on improving the lives of others and eventually building a future for our nation.
